## What is Programming?  
The process of writing computer programs to solve a particular problem/task is programming<br>
We instruct the computer!

## Logic Building  
When we say we instruct computers, there has to be a logic behind the algorithm we write to carry out a task, this thinking process refers to logic building

## Programming languages    
Just like humans have predefined languages with which we converse, programming language is the language/set of syntactic rules we use to instruct the computers<br>
The rules that define a structure for a particular language are known as syntax.

## Syntax v/s Logic  
There are around 6000 programming languages!<br>
Every language has a different syntax but the underlying logic  with which the problem is approached is the same<br>
Compare it with the emotions/message we want to convey with a language we use to do it!

## Competitive Programming
A domain of programming where a solution has to be coded for problem statements given to us<br>
You compete with other programmers in this domain and youâ€™re rated accordingly<br>
<i><u>Fun fact:</u></i><br>
It is considered to be a sport and the programmers are considered as sport programmers!
  
## Why CP?
 
It is the main crux of interviews for the companies!<br>
Alongside your resume and projects, your CP skills are tested right in the interview itself by the interviewer<br>
Also, improves our problem solving skills that we can apply to solve any potential logical problems our project code/company is facing

## Programming Roadmap

Learn a particular language and along with <b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b> in that language<br>
Practice DSA and then head on to attempt the questions on CP platforms<br>
<b>Platforms:</b><br>
HackerRank , CodeChef , Codeforces , LeetCode

That's it for the introduction, now let's dive into some concepts!
